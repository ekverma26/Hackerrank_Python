Marie invented a Time Machine and wants to test it by time-traveling to visit Russia on the Day of the Programmer (the  day of the year) during a year in the inclusive range from  to .

From  to , Russia's official calendar was the Julian calendar; since  they used the Gregorian calendar system. The transition from the Julian to Gregorian calendar system occurred in , when the next day after January  was February . This means that in , February  was the  day of the year in Russia.

In both calendar systems, February is the only month with a variable amount of days; it has  days during a leap year, and  days during all other years. In the Julian calendar, leap years are divisible by ; in the Gregorian calendar, leap years are either of the following:

Divisible by .
Divisible by  and not divisible by .
Given a year, , find the date of the  day of that year according to the official Russian calendar during that year. Then print it in the format dd.mm.yyyy, where dd is the two-digit day, mm is the two-digit month, and yyyy is .

For example, the given .  is divisible by , so it is a leap year. The  day of a leap year after  is September 12, so the answer is .
